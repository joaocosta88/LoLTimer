This repo contains the code of the Clouder Android application.


This application is a companion app for the League of Legends game. It's purpose is to connect all players of a team so that everyone is aware of when a buff or an enemy's ultimate is available.
The backend of this application is no longer enabled so the application will not work as expected.

Some screenshots of the application:
